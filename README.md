# YouOweMe
Android app created by Daniel Trey Hilburn. The application allows the user to enter work items with their prices and creates a bill that the user can take a screenshot of to save for later.

The first page the user sees allows him or her to add items to the bill via the "Add Work Item" button. Once the user types the text into the fields for the billing item and the price then he or she will press the "Add" button. After all items have been added and the user wants to generate the bill, the user will press the "Total" button which will display the item followed by its price below it. The user then can click on the "Screenshot" button to take a screenshot of the bill.
